# Title:
CIFAR10-PCA-LogReg-Reducing-Dimensions-and-Classifying-with-Logistic-Regression

# Description: 
* This project deals with neural image classification using PyTorch. Unveiling Patterns with PCA, visualizing Principal Components and navigating Image Classification with Logistic Regression
* Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset. It's often used to make data easy to explore and visualize. PCA is also a very useful dimesnionality reduction technique. Here it is explored how to apply PCA on the CIFAR dataset for dimensionality reduction and visualization of principle component.
* Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to assign observations to a discrete set of classes. Unlike linear regression which outputs continuous number values, logistic regression transforms its output using the logistic sigmoid function to return a probability value which can then be mapped to two or more discrete classes.
  
## Dataset used: 
CIFAR10 

## How to run the project:
* There is a single jupyter file.
* Open the file using google colab or VScode.
* The file contains both the implementation of PCA(dimensionality reduction & visualization)  and the Logistic Regression classifer.
* The file contains detailed clear description of each step performed and packages to install(if any).
